- What's up with that forEach() function? That thing is heavy-duty. It  can take up to four arguments:
a thisVar, element, index, and array. Pretty powerful stuff.

- The other thing with JavaScript is not seeing when you are passing a callback function as an argument,
as is the case with the forEach call.
